--Query A1: Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.

SELECT SUM(COST) AS TOTAL_COST
FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query A2: Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.

SELECT SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST
FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query A3: Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued.

SELECT MAX(QUANTITY)
FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query A4: Enter a function that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
